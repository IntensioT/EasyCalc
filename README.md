# Calculator with Variables and Functions

## Overview
This project is a simple calculator application with support for variables and user-defined functions. It is designed for practice in MODSEN.
The calculator provides a user interface for entering mathematical expressions, which can include numbers, operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), parentheses, variables, and user-defined functions. The application then parses the input, evaluates the expression, and displays the result.
## Features
* User interface for entering mathematical expressions
* Support for variables and user-defined functions* Parsing and evaluation of mathematical expressions
* Error handling for invalid input* Support for decimal and negative numbers
* Option to exit the program or enter a new expression after each calculation
## Requirements
* .NET Framework 4.5 or higher
